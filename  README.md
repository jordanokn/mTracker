### **mTracker – A Minimalist Task Tracker **  

**Philosophy:**  

- Kanban boards? Great for managers. *But for personal task tracking? Overkill.*  
- This is my answer: a tool for *my* workflow, not a committee’s.  
- No columns, no swimlanes—just a clean list to tame chaos when I’m juggling projects alone.  
- Proof that calm, focused work thrives on *less*, not more "management."  

**How It Works:**  

1. **One column. No Kanban.** Tasks flow top to bottom.  
2. **Timers** for deadlines or deep work.  
3. **Drag to reorder** when priorities shift—*not when process demands it*.  
4. **Done? Gone.** No retrospective, no clutter.
